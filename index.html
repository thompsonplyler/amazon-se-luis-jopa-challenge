        Luis Jopa Code Challenge
    </h1>
    <p>
        Great job on your project, Luis. Since we were not able to sync up
        and review your project together, we want to give you the opportunity to
        demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript in an asynchronous code
        challenge as an alternative to the Project Review. You will until Sunday at 11:59 PM ET to complete and
        submit it. By reading this message, you are acknowledging that you have
        received these instructions and should begin working as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <p>Read <em>all</em> of the instructions carefully.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Fork and clone the following repository onto your local machine:
                <a href="https://github.com/thompsonplyler/basic-html-project">Repo Link</a>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="once-you-have-finished">Once you have finished</h2>
    <p>
        Commit and push your changes to your fork like you would after completing
        a lab using the following commands in the code challenge directory:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git add .</code></li>
        <li><code>git commit -m "Completed assignment"</code></li>
        <li><code>git push</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="project-setup.">Project Setup.</h2>
    <p>First, create an HTML webpage that is connected to a JavaScript file. CSS Styling is <strong>not</strong>
        optional, although good styling IS optional.</p>
    <p>With regard to your CSS, the intention of this code challenge is that you demonstrate an understanding of linking
        CSS to your HTML and, if relevant, your JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the larger purpose of this challenge is for you to demonstrate a clear understanding of how
        JavaScript, unassisted by libraries such as jQuery or React, manipulates the DOM. For this reason, for any of
        the deliverables below, it is imperative you <strong>do not use <code>.innerHTML</code></strong>.</p>
    <h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
    <p>Your HTML file must have the following elements and event listeners:
    <ol>
        <li>
            A <strong>button</strong> that will
            display an element on screen when clicked.
        </li>
        <li>
            The newly displayed element should have a location (such as a new
            button) that will allow the user to hide it again, i.e. a way to close the new element. It is not important
            how
            you choose to hide the element, e.g. <code>opacity: 0</code>, <code>display: none</code>,
            <code>element.remove()</code>)
        </li>
        <li>
            Your HTML file must include an image somewhere. It can be hard-coded, or you
            can generate it with (1). Attach an event listener to this image that will place the image in fullscreen
            mode
            when it is double-clicked. (BIG HINT: Don’t use CSS for this. We are asking for a specific
            <strong>method</strong> for JavaScript in the browser. You have encountered neither the double-click event
            nor
            this method through Flatiron materials.)
        </li>
    </ol>
